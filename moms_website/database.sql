Outside of teaching, you'll find me engrossed in a good book, as I believe in the power of storytelling to ignite young imaginations. We embark on daily journeys of problem-solving and language exploration, crafting our own stories along the way.

Building a sense of community is important to me. We celebrate victories, learn from challenges, and cherish the connections we make in our classroom. Every day is an opportunity for growth, laughter, and a bit of fun.

Beyond school, I enjoy nature walks, experimenting with recipes, and staying informed about children's literature. As your guide, cheerleader, and friend, I'm here for this exciting educational adventure.

So, get ready for a school year filled with exploration, learning, and the endless possibilities that await us!");
